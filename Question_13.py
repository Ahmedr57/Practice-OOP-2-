# Write a program that defines a base class Animal with a method speak(). Create a subclass Dog that overrides the speak() method. 
# Implement another class RobotDog that inherits from both Dog and a class Robot using multiple inheritance. 
# Ensure that the speak() method uses the super() function correctly to call the Dog's method.
